      <p class=warning><span id=warning>Disclaimer: I don't have a top 5 in <em>books, foods, songs, and movies</em>, so I took the liberty of slightly bending the instructions of the assignment, without altering its operational objectives.</span></p> 
      <p><span id=text>First, I replaced books with youtube channels, as that's what I primarily use to learn about the world, and wrote them down in simple alphabetical order. Admittedly, one of them is far more specific than the others.</br>
  I then listed my favorite beers, since they're technically food. Now, since their hierarchy depends on weather and context, I opted here again for an unordered list in alphabetical order.</br>
  I switched from "songs" to "bands" (because there are indeed five bands that I have listened to more than any other artist), and arranged them in chronological order of appearance in my life (hence why I used an ordered list this time).</br>
  Regarding movies, these are just a snapshot of what I find inspiring at the  moment. Again, alphabetical order by default.</br>
  Last but not least, I embedded those four lists in an unordered list because I liked how it looked.</span></p>

      <p class=warning><span id=warning>A few notes for the corrector (see html file or remove background color on "#warning" for easier reading): </br></br>

  About disclaimers: I'm rather unhappy with the way I managed my first (and last) paragraph : I had to create both a class "warning" and an id "warning", because the property "text-align" needs a block element, whereas "background-color" had to be declared relatively to an inline element in order to "stick to the text" (instead of covering the whole screen width). 
Besides, I don't understand how the id "warning" worked on both paragraphs since it is supposed to work only once. Plus it looks awful because the paddings of all lines of text overlap each other and I can't figure out why. 

  About lists: I don't like the fact that the background width is fixed (all the lists are 145pt wide). It should only be as wide as the longest line (+ padding), as it does for the list titles. Again, it's a "block elements vs inline elements" issue in my opinion, but how exactly does it work? 
I also had to create both a class and an id for my main list in order to have both padding (inline) and colored bulletpoints
Moreover, I really wanted to have several lists sharing the width of the page instead of having them all one under another, butwhen I tried to apply the property "float:left" to my div named "list", they would form some kind of stairs. I believe that this happened because I embedded them inside of the "main list", not sure why though. 
So I divided the main list into 4 different lists of 1 item each (again, 4 items sharing the same id, that's not supposed to work, right?) and applied "float:left" to the class "mainList" and the "clear:both" property on the following item (a bit messily because I got lazy). Worked wonder, but I hope that the same result could be achieved in a simpler fashion.

  About spacing: I used a div element to create space under my main title and between sections. Surely there's a more elegant way to do so. 

  About CSS: I think I could have made a better job at optimizing readability. How are you supposed to arrange your code? By order of appearance in html, as I did? Alphabetically? By categories?

If you have ideas on how to fix any of that, please let me know through your commentary. And if you don't feel like answering any of this, that's totally ok too, I will figure this all out by myself eventually. Thanks for reading!</span></p>
